## Abstract

This paper presents a simple analysis of house music compositions. Using sound source separation techniques, the drums, bass, vocals, and other elements were isolated, and their sound pressure was calculated. The analysis revealed that drums and bass greatly impact the music structure, while other parts have less influence. Opportunities for improving the identification of intro and outro sections were identified.

Please note that the above abstract is a summary of the research paper. For the full details and findings, please refer to the complete manuscript.
